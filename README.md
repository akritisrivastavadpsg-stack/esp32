##
A basic ESP32 hardware project designed using KiCad. This repository contains the schematic and PCB layout files for an ESP32-based setup, intended for learning, experimentation, and future expansion.

📌 Project Overview

This project focuses on:

Understanding ESP32 pin mapping

Creating a clean schematic

Designing a basic PCB layout in KiCad

Laying groundwork for firmware-based ESP32 projects

No unnecessary complexity. Just the essentials done right.

🛠 Tools & Software

KiCad (v6 or later recommended)

ESP32 module (e.g., ESP32-WROOM-32)

Basic understanding of schematics & PCB design
